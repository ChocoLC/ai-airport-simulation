# Contributing to AI Airport Simulation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AI Airport Simulation project! This project serves as a testing playground for Large Language Models (LLMs) in air traffic control scenarios.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project is designed to:
- **Test and compare different LLMs** in safety-critical decision making
- **Evaluate AI performance** in real-time traffic management scenarios  
- **Provide a standardized benchmark** for LLM evaluation in aviation contexts
- **Research AI behavior** under pressure and emergency situations

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (venv, conda, etc.)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-airport-simulation.git
cd ai-airport-simulation

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest  # When tests are added

# Run simulation
python main.py
```

## ü§ù How to Contribute

- Test with various scenarios
- Document performance characteristics

### 2. Simulation Features
Enhance the airport simulation:
- Add new aircraft states or behaviors
- Improve collision detection algorithms
- Create new emergency scenarios
- Enhance fuel management systems

### 3. Testing & Benchmarking
Improve evaluation capabilities:
